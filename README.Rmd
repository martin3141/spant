## Overview

spant provides a full suite of tools to build automated analysis pipelines for Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) data. The following features and algorithms are included:

* Advanced fully-automated metabolite fitting algorithm - ABfit https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.28385.
* Robust retrospective frequency and phase correction - RATS https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.27605.
* Support for common MRS data formats including read / write NIfTI MRS - https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.29418.
* Flexible data types to support single voxel, dynamic and spectroscopic imaging.
* Raw data import from individual coils and dynamic measurements, eg support for importing individual FIDs from Siemens TWIX formatted data.
* Publication quality plotting.
* Extensive set of pre-processing steps (phasing, coil-combination, zero-filling, HSVD filtering...).
* Quantum mechanical based simulation for experimental design and basis-set generation.
* Set of metabolite, macromolecule and lipid parameters for typical brain analyses.
* Voxel registration to anatomical images for partial volume concentration corrections.

## Documentation

The [online spant user manual](https://spantdoc.wilsonlab.co.uk/) ([pdf version](https://spantdoc.wilsonlab.co.uk/spant-User-Manual.pdf)) is written for users with minimal experience in R or MRS processing and is the best place to start.

For more advanced users, help developing custom analysis pipeline can be found
below.

Introduction : https://martin3141.github.io/spant/articles/spant-intro.html

Short tutorials : https://martin3141.github.io/spant/articles/

Function reference : https://martin3141.github.io/spant/reference/

Once the spant library has been loaded with `library(spant)`, type `?spant` on the console for instructions on how to access the offline documentation. Note that offline help on the available functions can be quickly shown in RStudio using `?function_name`, eg `?read_mrs`.

## Basic installation

Download and install the latest version of R (https://cloud.r-project.org/), or with your package manager if using a recent Linux distribution, eg `sudo apt install r-base`.

It is also strongly recommended to install RStudio Desktop (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download) to provide a modern environment for interactive data analysis.

Once R and RStudio have been installed, open the RStudio application and type the following in the Console (lower left panel) to install the latest stable version of spant:
```{r cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("spant", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Or the the development version from GitHub (requires the `devtools` package):
```{r github, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("martin3141/spant", ref = "devel", dependencies = TRUE)
```
